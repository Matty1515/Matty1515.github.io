<div id="Intro">
  <div class="container">
    <p>Starting in 1987, the Rugby World Cup is an international rugby union tournament held every four years to determine the best rugby nation in the world. Twenty teams compete in the Rugby World Cup (16 before 1999) and the winner of the tournament is awarded the William Webb Ellis Cup. There have been 8 Rugby World Cup tournaments although only 4 nations have ever won it - New Zealand (3 times), Australia (2), South Africa (2), England (1). Jonny Wilkinson in the tournament's overall top point scorer with 277 points and Bryan Habana and Jonah Lomu are joint top try scorers with 15 tries.

    <h3>Rugby World Cup 2019</h3>
	<p>After bids from South Africa, Japan and Italy, it was decided on the 28th of July 2009 that Japan would host the 2019 Rugby World Cup. This is the first time that a Rugby World Cup will take place in Asia which shows the expanding appeal of rugby union around the world. The tournament will take place between September 20th and November 2nd with the final being hosted in the International Stadium in Yokohama. ITV have the broadcasting rights for the UK (eirSports for Ireland). Japan is 9 hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time so England games will likely be on in the morning (for example the final is 9.00am GMT).</p>

    <h3>Qualification</h3>
	<p>The top three teams from each of the 2015 Rugby World Cup pool stages qualify for this world cup. So, Australia, Wales and England were the top three teams from Pool A so they automatically qualify. Japan also automatically qualify as they are the hosts and the remaining teams are made up of regional slots and various play-offs. Below is an image explaining the qualification process in more detail (credit to Alexei17777 from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rugby_World_Cup_2019_Qualification_illustrated_v2.png">Wikipedia</a> for creating this image).</p>

    <p>Anyway, England have already qualified as have all of the other home nations.</p>

  <h3>Pool Stage</h3>
  <p>The draw to decide the World Cup groups took place on the 10th of May 2017 in Kyoto. England were in Band 1 as the #2 seed although that didn't stop them from getting a tough group! Each team will play every other team in their group once with 4 points for a win, 2 for a draw and 0 for a loss. A winning bonus point is awarded for scoring four or more tries, and a losing bonus point is awarded for losing by less than 8 points.</p>
