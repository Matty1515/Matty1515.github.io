Whilst contact to the head in rugby is prohibited, accidents do happen so it is important that you get a reliable gum sheild that will protect you and stay in place for the whole match. This review will look take a look at the best selling gum shields on Amazon and let you determine which will be the best for you.</p>

	  <p>The Beast Gear Mouth Guard is by far the most popular option for gum shields on Amazon. It has the style, the quality and the sturdiness to make it the best on the market.</p>
      <img class="img-responsive" alt="popular mouth guard / gum shield" src="../img/Products/GumShield3.jpg">
      <p>It is the Amazon Choice for the "mouth guard" category which means that it is very highly rated by the Amazon community. It is Latex free and comes with a sterile case for clean storage which is also handy if you have a tendency to misplace your gum shield like me. It has a clean but stylish black and white design with a popular brand label on the front. There are instructions for how to mould it to your teeth included in the package so I won't waste space explaining it here but it is very easy to do. Overall, I think this is the best mouth guard on the market and I would strongly recommend it.</p>

	  <p>Mouth guards come in a variety of brands and styles but fundamentally, they do the same thing. Sure some are a bit sturdier than others but is that really worth the huge price difference? If this is your approach to gum shields then this is the option for you.</p>
      <img class="img-responsive" alt="cheap mouth guard / gum shield" src="../img/Products/GumShield1.jpg">
      <p>The ZOR mouth guard uses the traditional boil-and-bite method of moulding to you're teeth. Essentially, put it in a glass of near boiling water, wait till it cools off a little bit and then mould it to your teeth. It is also made from medicated hygienic food grade material which helps it avoid smelling after being in your mouth for a while. The only downside is that it is a generic brand with little style (just one block colour). If that doesn't bother you though, then this is definitely the best option for you.</p>

	  <p>We've explored the popular and cheap options but, for a lot of people, what you want out of a mouth guard is strength. Now, the previous two are definitely tough but when it comes strength you will want to get the Shock Doctor Mouth Guard.</p>
      <img class="img-responsive" alt="sturdy mouth guard / gum shield" src="../img/Products/GumShield2.jpg">
      <p>The Shock Doctor Mouth Guard has an exoskeletal shock frame and a triple layer design to help protect you against any impacts you will face on a rugby pitch. Like the ZOR in the previous example, this gum shield also uses the boil and bite technique to fit perfectly to your mouth. However, due to the fact that it's a lot thicker than the ZOR you might need to spend a bit longer getting it to fit. I don't think that's a big problem though as the pay off is that you get much better protection in the long run. The Shock Doctor comes in a whole range of colours from black to bright orange so there's a lot more customisation than with the Beast Gear. There are two negative points I feel I need to mention though - 1) The price tag is quite steep for a mouth guard 2) It is quite bulky and will take some time getting used to it in your mouth. Overall, I do consider it a good option if you want that extra bit of protection</p>
